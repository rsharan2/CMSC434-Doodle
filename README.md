# CMSC434-Doodle

This an drawing Android app for CMSC434 at University of Maryland College Park.  

Features implemented:
 * Changing brush size
 * Changing opacity
 * Changing color
 * Clearing canvas
 * Undo and Redo

The first three features are changed using three seek bars. One interesting thing is when changing the color of the brush, the color of the text next to the seek bar changes to reflect the color. 
The clearing canvas, and undo/redo are done using three buttons. The undo and redo buttons are only enabled when it makes sense to use these features. Clearing the canvas also clears the undo/redo history.
